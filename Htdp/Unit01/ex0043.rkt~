;Exercise 43. Let’s work through the same problem statement with a
;time-based data definition:
;
;    ; An AnimationState is a Number.
;    ; interpretation the number of clock ticks 
;    ; since the animation started
;
;Like the original data definition, this one also equates the states
;of the world with the class of numbers. Its interpretation, however,
;explains that the number means something entirely different.
;
;Design the functions tock and render. Then develop a big-bang
;expression so that once again you get an animation of a car
;traveling from left to right across the world’s canvas.
;
;
;How do you think this program relates to animate from Prologue: How
;to Program?
;
;Use the data definition to design a program that moves the car
;according to a sine wave. (Don’t try to drive like that.)
