;The problem statement specifies how the number of attendees depends on
;the ticket price. Computing this number is clearly a separate task and
;thus deserves its own function definition:

    (define (attendees ticket-price)
      (- 120 (* (- ticket-price 5.0) (/ 15 0.1))))

;The revenue is exclusively generated by the sale of tickets, meaning
;it is exactly the product of ticket price and number of attendees:

    (define (revenue ticket-price)
      (* ticket-price (attendees ticket-price)))

;The cost consists of two parts: a fixed part ($180) and a variable
;part that depends on the number of attendees. Given that the number of
;attendees is a function of the ticket price, a function for computing
;the cost of a show must also consume the ticket price so that it can
;reuse the attendees function:

    (define (cost ticket-price)
      (+ 180 (* 0.04 (attendees ticket-price))))

;Finally, profit is the difference between revenue and costs for some
;given ticket price:

    (define (profit ticket-price)
      (- (revenue ticket-price)
         (cost ticket-price)))
