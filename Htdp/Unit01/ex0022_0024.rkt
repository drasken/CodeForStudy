;Exercise 22. Use DrRacketâ€™s stepper on this program fragment:

(define (distance-to-origin x y)
  (sqrt (+ (sqr x) (sqr y))))

(distance-to-origin 3 4)

;Exercise 23. The first 1String in "hello world" is "h". How does the
;following function compute this result?

(define (string-first s)
  (substring s 0 1))

(string-first "Hello world"); print "H"

;Exercise 24. Here is the definition of ==>:

    (define (==> x y)
      (or (not x) y))

;Use the stepper to determine the value of (==> #true #false).
