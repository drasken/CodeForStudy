Exercise 47. Design a world program that maintains and displays a “happiness gauge.” Let’s call it gauge-prog, and let’s agree that happiness is a number between 0 and 100 (inclusive).

The gauge-prog program consumes the current level of happiness. With each clock tick, the happiness level decreases by 0.1; it never falls below 0 though. Every time the down arrow key is pressed, happiness decreases by 1/5; every time the up arrow is pressed, happiness jumps by 1/3.

To show the level of happiness, we use a scene with a solid, red rectangle with a black frame. For a happiness level of 0, the red bar should be gone; for the maximum happiness level of H, the bar should go all the way across the scene.
