Notes to help me guiding me in my simple project:


Milestones (high level):

1. Board representation & I/O
2. Cell utilities & constraints
3. Basic logical solvers (deterministic techniques)
4. Backtracking search with heuristics
5. Validation, performance, and testing
6. Optional: GUI / file import / advanced techniques
