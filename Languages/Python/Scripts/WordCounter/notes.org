Test scripting in Python

Using this approach:

#! /usr/bin/env python

> ./main.py <input-file-here>

Just toy project to re-start with python. Take a file in input and
return the number of words in it.

First simple approach: using built in split and return number of
words. Check for special characters if everything works rigth
