Trying to do a simple sudoku solver es exercise

* How to solve it

** First idea

- Using a matrix of 9x9 to store sudoku values. Empty cells have 0
- Using a transpose matrix to access columns
- Maybe using a list of blocks? Can modify in-place?
- Trying simple backtracking procedure. Check for each empty cell 

** Task TODO [2/7]

- [X] Implement init function to make a blank table
- [X] implement a populate_table function to populate sudoku table.
- [ ] LATER: a function to get an input state and create a sudoku
  table from that
- [ ] Function that for each cell get the set of possible choices
- [ ] Utility function that check is state is a valid stat
- [ ] Main loop that traverse the table
- [ ] Output the final  sudoku state
