;; This file is the main file to make a script that searcha a directory tree and:
;; - From a starting directory check all files
;; - Get a digest for each files and stores it (still undecided how)
;; - Does it recursively for each sub directory
;; - When it's done, write on a log each path for files that produced same digest
;; Optional features:
;; - Choose a level of depth for the recursive search
;; - Let the user stop the search while doing it from keyboard
;; - Maybe let the user choose the starting directory not just the CWD
;; - Maybe let the user choos the name and location for log file (check location)


;; Here main function
(defun main ()
